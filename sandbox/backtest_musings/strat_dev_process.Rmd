abstract: Analysts and portfolio managers face many challenges in developing new systematic trading systems.  This paper provides a detailed, repeatable process to aid in evaluating new ideas, developing those ideas into testable hypotheses, measuring results in comparable ways, and avoiding and measuring the ever-present risks of over-fitting. ^[ *Back-testing. I hate it –- it's just optimizing over history. You never see a bad back-test. Ever. In any strategy.* - Josh Diedesch[-@Diedesch2014] ]

# Constraints, Benchmarks, and Objectives ^[*Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful*. - George Box[-@Box1987] ]

It is important to understand what you are trying to achieve 
*before* you set out to achieve it.  

Without a set of clearly defined goals there is great potential to 
accept a strategy or backtest that is really incompatible with the
(previously unstated) business objectives and constraints.
Worse, it can lead to adjusting your goal to try to follow the 
backtest, which can culminate in all sorts of bad decision making, and also
increases the probability of erroneously accepting an overfitted backtest.

## Understanding your business constraints (and advantages)

Think about the constraints, costs, and advantages that you are under
first, before formulating a hypothesis, or writing a strategy specification.
Many strategists skip this step.  Don't.  It is a waste of time and 
energy to design a strategy for a constraint set that is not available to you.

Some examples include:

  - execution platform
  - access and proximity to markets
  - products you can trade
  - data availability and management
  - business structure
  - capital available 
  - fees/rebates


## Choosing a benchmark {#benchmarks}

The choice of what benchmarks to measure yourself against provides both
opportunities for better understanding your performance and risks of
benchmark chasing and overfitting.
Mutual Fund managers have it easy, or hard, because of the "Morningstar"
categorization of styles and benchmarks.  Mutual fund managers have 
benchmarks clearly defined, and can be easily measured against what are 
often exchange traded products or well known indices.  
A good suite of benchmarks for your strategy should reflect your business
objectives and constraints, as well as help you measure performance over
time.

## What constitutes a good benchmark for a trading strategy?  

There are several categories of potential benchmarks:

1. archetypal strategies

    In many cases, you can use a well-known archetypal strategy 
    as a benchmark.  For example, a momentum strategy could use 
    an MA-cross strategy as a benchmark.  
    If you are comparing two or more candidate indicators or 
    signal processes, you can also use one as a benchmark for 
    the other (more on this later).
   
2. alternative indices

    EDHEC, Barclays, HFR, and others offer alternative investment 
    style indices. One of these may be a good fit as a benchmark 
    for your strategy.  Be aware that they tend to have a downward 
    bias imposed by averaging, or are even averages of averages.
    So 'beating the benchmark' in your backtest would be a bare
    minimum first step if using one of these as your benchmark.
    As an example, many CTA's are trend followers, so a momentum 
    strategy in commodities may often be fairly compared to a
    CTA index. 
   
3. custom tracking portfolios  

    In some ways an extension of (1.) above, you can create your own benchmark 
    by creating a custom tracking portfolio. As the most common example, a 
    cap-weighted index is really a strategy archetype.  The tracking portfolio 
    for a capitalization-weighted index invests in a basket of securities using 
    market capitalization as the weights for the portfolio. This portfolio is 
    then rebalanced on the schedule defined in the index specification 
    (typically quarterly or annually). Components may be added or removed 
    following some rule at these rebalancing periods, or on some other abnormal 
    event such as a bankruptcy. Other custom tracking portfolios or synthetic 
    strategies may also be appropriate for measuring your strategy against, 
    depending on what edge(s) the strategy hopes to capture, and from what 
    universe of investible products. 
   
4. market observables  
   
    Market observable benchmarks are perhaps the simplest 
    available benchmarks, and can tie in well 
    to business [objectives](#objective) and 
    to [optimization](#optimization).
   
    Some easily observable benchmarks in this category:
   
    - $/day, %/day
    - $/contract
    - % daily volume
    - % open interest
   
## measuring performance against your benchmark

Good benchmarks help to provide insight into the drivers of strategy returns.

Choosing more than one benchmark can help to guard against 
targeting the benchmark (a form of overfitting).
Identifying specific limitations of your benchmarks, for example:

 - lack of goodness of fit, 
 - a different investible universe, 
 - lack of stationarity, 
 - or specific representative features of the benchmark 
 
can also assist in refining the choice of benchmarks
and avoiding taking them too seriously.  

No matter what benchmarks you pick, if you are going to share 
these benchmarks with outside investors or other members of your
team, you need to be careful that you understand and disclose 
the limitations of the benchmark(s) that you've chosen.  
Failure to disclose known divergences from a benchmark you will 
be measured against may look like a limitation rather than a 
feature, so be sure to explain why differences should exist.

You *will* be measured by others against these benchmarks for 
performance, style drift, etc. so failure to disclose known
limitations of your benchmark(s) will waste everyone's time. 

Large bodies of research have been built up over time about how to 
measure performance against such benchmarks. *TrackingError*,
*SharpeRatio*'s, *FactorAnalytics*, and more are well 
represented in **R**.  

## Choosing an Objective ^[*When measuring results against objectives, start by making sure the objectives are correct.* - Ben @Horowitz2014]

In strategy creation, it is very dangerous to start without a clear
objective.  

Market observable benchmarks (see above) may form the core of 
the first objectives you use to evaluate strategy ideas.  

Your business objective states the types of returns you require for your 
capital, your tail risk objectives, the amount of leverage you intend to 
or are willing to use, and your drawdown constraints (which are closely 
related to the leverage you intend to employ). 

Some of the constraints on your business objective may be dictated by the 
constraints your business structure has (see above).

For example:
- Leverage constraints generally have a hard limit imposed 
by the entity you are using to access the market, whether that is a 
broker/dealer, a 106.J membership, a leased seat, a clearing member,
or a customer relationship.  
- Drawdown constraints have hard limits dictated
by the leverage you intend to employ: 10:1 leverage imposes a 10% hard 
drawdown constraint, 4:1 imposes a 25% drawdown constraint, and so on.
- Often, there will also be certain return objectives below which a strategy 
is not worth doing.

Ideally, the business objectives for the strategy will be specified as
ranges, with minimum acceptable, desired target, and maximum acceptable or
plausible targets.

Once you have these objectives described, you need to formulate them so that 
they may be easily used to programmatically evaluate your strategy.
^[**FIXME** *we need a version of constrained_objective() from PortA in quantstrat*]

\newthought{Formulate your business objectives} in the same form commonly 
used in portfolio optimization:

 *maximize some measure of return *
 
 *subject to *
 
 *minimizing one or more measures of risk *
 
The most commonly used objective of this type is the Sharpe Ratio 
which is most often calculated as mean return over volatility.
  
Many other modified Sharpe-style ratios also exist:

* Information Ratio: annualized return over annualized risk
* Profit factor: gross profits divided by gross losses
* Sortino Ratio: (annualized return - risk free) over downside volatility
* Calmar Ratio: annualized return  over max drawdown
* return over expected tail loss

All of these ratios have the properties that you want to 
maximize them in optimization, and that they are roughly comparable 
across different trading systems.

Additional properties of the trading system that you may target 
when evaluating strategy performance but which we would not put into the
category of *business requirements* include:

 * correlation to perfect profit
 * slope of the equity curve
 * linearity of the equity curve
 * trade statistics
 etc.
 
A strategy conceptualized as a diversifier for an 
existing suite may well have different business objectives from a strategy
designed to enter a new market or replicate published research or 
take advantage of a transient market opportunity. 
As such, it is further important to be aware that business objectives 
are likely to differ from one strategy to another even inside the same 
organization or on the same team.  
 
Understanding your constraints, benchmarks, and objectives prior to 
embarking on hypothesis generation or strategy creation and evaluation 
will anchor your goals.  Defining these in advance will allow you to 
quickly reject ideas that are incompatible with your goals and requirements.
Proceeding without understanding the milieu in which the proposed
strategy will operate risks overfitting and sloppy analysis, and
should be avoided whenever possible.

# Hypothesis Driven Development ^[*Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise*. - John Tukey [-@Tukey1962] p. 13 ]
Strategy creation is expensive in time (for research) 
and money (for implementation into a live trading environment).

To maximize return on that investment, we follow a hypothesis driven 
approach that allows us to confirm ideas quickly, 
reject failures cheaply, and avoid many of the dangers of overfitting.

Ideas generated via a brainstorming session are a useful starting 
point, but they are typically not testable on their own.

## creating good (testable) hypotheses

To create a testable idea (a hypothesis), we need to:

- formulate the idea as a declarative conjecture
- make sure the conjecture is predictive
- define the expected outcome of that conjecture
- describe means of verifying (testing) the expected outcome

Many ideas will fail the process at this point.  The idea will be 
intriguing or interesting, but not able to be formulated as a conjecture.  
Or, once formatted as a conjecture, you won't be able to 
formulate an expected outcome.  Often, the conjecture is a statement
about the nature of markets.  This may be an interesting, and 
even verifiable point, but not be a *prediction* about market behavior. 
So a good conjecture also makes a prediction, or an observation that 
amounts to a prediction.  The prediction must specify either a cause, 
or an observable state that precedes the predicted outcome.

Finally, a good hypothesis must specify its own test(s). It should describe
how the hypothesis will be verified. A non-testable "working hypothesis" is a 
starting point for further investigation, but the goal has to be to specify 
tests.  In some cases, it is sufficient to describe a test of the
prediction. We'll cover specific tests in depth later in this document. In
statistical terms, we need the hypothesis to have a testable dependent
variable.   In other cases it may be necessary to describe a statistical test
to differentiate the hypothesized prediction from other measurable effects,
or from noise, or factor interactions. Specified tests should identify
measurable things that can help identify the (spurious) appearance of a valid 
hypothesis.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{hypothesis_process}
\end{marginfigure}

A good/complete hypothesis statement includes:

- what is being analyzed (the subject), 
- the dependent variable(s) (the output/result/prediction)
- the independent variables (inputs into the model)
- the anticipated possible outcomes, including direction or comparison
- addresses *how you will validate or refute each hypothesis*

\newthought{Most strategy ideas will be rejected} during hypothesis 
creation and testing.

Many ideas, thoughts, and observations about the state of the markets 
lack sufficient structure to become a testable hypothesis.  While it 
is possible that these ideas are indeed true, unless you can quantify 
the idea into a (dis)provable conjecture, it can't be used to create a 
quantitative strategy with any degree of confidence. Far from being a 
negative thing, this is a good use of your time, and guards against 
prematurely moving on with a fundamentally questionable or just 
plain erroneous idea.  The faster an untestable idea can be set aside 
for more verifiable ideas, the better.

\newthought{Proceeding without a hypothesis risks ruin.} ^[*A big computer, 
a complex algorithm and a long time does not equal science. - Robert Gentleman*]
Many strategists will still try to skip robust hypotheses in favor of sloppy 
ones such as "I hypothesize that this strategy idea will make money". 

While the value of testing a more rigorous hypothesis should be clear, it may 
be more difficult to see the risks imposed by having no hypothesis or a sloppy 
or incomplete hypothesis.  An incomplete or otherwise deficient hypothesis at 
this stage will create a strong desire to "refine" the hypothesis later by 
adding new explanatory statements.  This is called an "ad hoc hypothesis", 
where new hypotheses are piled on top of old to better "explain" observation.
(@Carroll2011 , p. 7 or online; see also "rule burden", below) 
Engaging in the creation of ad hoc hypotheses risks ruin, as the 
in sample (IS) explanatory power of the model will seem to go up, while the
out of sample (OOS) power goes down.  It also invites going over the data 
multiple times while the model is "refined", introducing progressively 
more data snooping bias.

# Defining the strategy

A trading strategy or investment approach is more than just 
a testable hypothesis.
 
After creating and confirming a hypothesis, you need to specify the strategy.
The **R** package *quantstrat* formalizes the strategy structure into 
*filters*, *indicators*, *signals*, and *rules*.

\newthought{Filters} help to select the instruments to trade.  
They may be part of the formulated hypothesis, or they may be market 
characteristics that allow the rest of the strategy to trade better.  
In fundamental equity investing, some strategies consist only of filters.  
For example, the StarMine package that was bought by Thomson Reuters defines 
quantitative stock screens based on technicals or fundamentals.^[a modern, free
alternative may be found at http://finviz.com/screener.ashx]
Many analysts will expand or shrink their investible universe based on screens. 
Lo's Variance Ratio is another measure often used as a filter to turn the 
strategy on or off for particular instruments (but can also be used as an 
indicator, since it is time-varying).

\newthought{Indicators} are quantitative values derived from market data.

Examples of indicators include moving averages, RSI, MACD, volatility bands,
channels, factor models, and theoretical pricing models.  They are calculated 
in advance on market data (or on other indicators). Indicators have no 
knowledge of current positions or trades.

One risk to watch out for when defining your indicators is confusing the 
indicator with the strategy.  The indicator is a description of reality,
a model that describes some aspect of the market, or a theoretical price.
An indicator, on its own, is not a strategy.  The strategy depends on 
interactions with the rest of its components to be fully specified.  
         
\newthought{Signals} describe the interaction between filters, market data, 
and indicators. 

Signal processes describe the desire for an action, 
but the strategy may choose not to act or may not be actionable at the time. 
They include 'classic' things like crossovers and thresholds, 
as well as more complicated interactions between pricing models, other 
indicators, and other signal processes.  It is our experience that signals 
may often interact with other signals. The final signal is a composite
of multiple things.  The combination of intermediate signals will increase the 
likelihood of actually  placing or modifying orders based on the final signal.

Like indicators, signals are calculated in advance on market data
while doing research or a backtest.  In production, they are typically calculated 
in a streaming fashion. 

As stated above, it is important to separate the desire for action from the 
action itself. The signal happens only in its own context.  In very simple 
strategies, signal and action may be the same, but in most real strategies 
the separation serves to make clear what analysis can be done to support a
decision, and what needs to be postponed until a path-dependent 
decision is warranted.  
         
\newthought{Rules} make path-dependent actionable decisions.

Rules, in both research/backtesting and in production, are what take input 
from market data, indicators, and signals, and actually take action. 
Entry, Exits, Risk, Profit Taking, and Portfolio Rebalancing are all
rule processes.  Rules are path dependent, meaning that they are aware of 
the current market state, the current portfolio, all working orders,
and any other data available at the time the rule is being evaluated. 
No action is instantaneous, so rules also have a cost in time.  
There must be some lag between observation (indicator or signal),
decision (rule), and action (order entry or modification).

## strategy specification document

The strategy specification document is a complete description of the
strategy. A draft covering all components of the strategy should be
completed before any code is written. It describes the business context and
objectives, the hypothesis and tests for that hypothesis, and all the
components of the strategy itself (filters, indicators, signals and rules).
It also needs to describe details such as initial parameter choices and why
those choices were made, and any data requirements (tick, bar, L2, external
data, etc.).

The strategy specification needs to be written at a level sufficient for the
research analyst to write code from. Equally important, it should be
written for review by the investment and risk committees.

One of the key reasons for writing the specification before beginning coding, 
beyond clarity and rigor of thinking, is that it provides another curb against 
overfitting.  Changes to the specification should be deliberate, recorded 
and indicate that something was incomplete or erroneous in the initial 
specification.  The strategy designer will learn from success and failure 
along the development path, and the outcomes of these incremental 
experiments should be clearly reflected in the strategy specification 
and its revision history.

\newthought{Specification changes need to be conscious and recorded.}
Loosely adjusting the specification as you go increases the likelihood 
of an overfit and invalid test.

# Creating the Strategy

Creating the strategy code for backtesting or production is outside the 
scope of this document. In **R** you'll likely use *quantstrat*, and
when transitioning to production, you'll use whatever execution platforms
are supported by your organization or team.

\newthought{Developing and testing the strategy in stages} using the tools 
described in the following sections makes the strategy development process 
less expensive, more rigorous, and less subject to over-fitting.  This is in 
contrast to the process described by many of the references in this document
which focus *only* on evaluating the entire strategy at once, and modifying
the whole strategy before doing another analytical trial.

# Evaluating the Strategy ^[*No matter how beautiful your theory, no matter how clever you are or what your name is, if it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong*. - Richard P. Feynman [-@Feynman1965]]         
 
\newthought{How do you evaluate the backtest?}

Conceptually, the goal should continue to be to reject or fix failures 
quickly, before getting to the point of something that risks feeling too
expensive to throw away.  We want to evaluate the backtest against 
our hypothesis and business objectives.  The earlier in the strategy 
framework we can identify and correct problems, the less likely we are 
to fall victim to common errors in backtesting:
  
\newthought{Look Ahead Biases} are introduced when an analysis directly uses knowledge 
  of future events.  They are most commonly found when using 'corrected'
  or 'final' numbers in a backtest rather than the correct 'vintage' of data.
  Other common examples are using the mean of the entire series, or 
  using only surviving securities in an analysis performed after several 
  candidate securities have been de-listed.  [see @baquero2005]
  Look ahead bias is relatively easily corrected for in backtests by 
  subsetting the data at each step so that indicators, signals, and rules
  only have access to the data that would have been contemporaneously 
  available.  Guarding against vintage or survivorship problems requires 
  slightly more work, as the analyst must be aware that the data being 
  used for the analysis comes in vintages.

\newthought{Data Mining Bias} arises from testing multiple configurations 
  and parameters of a trading system without carefully controlling for the 
  introduction of bias.  It is typically caused by brute force searching 
  of the parameter space without a driving hypothesis for why those parameters 
  would be good candidates.[see @Aronson2006, Chapter 6, pp.287-320]

  Correcting for data mining bias is covered in Aronson, and consists
  mostly in designing the tests such that you do not pollute your data.
  Walk forward analysis (covered later) is a key component of this,
  as are adjustments and measurements of data mining effects after they occur.
  
\newthought{Data snooping} is the process by which knowledge of the data set 
  contaminates your statistical testing (your backtest) because you 
  have already looked at the data.  In an innocuous form, it 
  could occur simply because you have market knowledge. [see @mistakes2011] Tukey 
  called this "uncomfortable science" because of the bias that it can introduce,
  but knowledge of how markets work, and what things have worked in the past
  is an essential part of strategy development.  What you need to be cautious
  of is making changes to the *strategy* to overcome specific deficiencies
  you see in testing.  These types of changes, while sometimes unavoidable 
  and even desirable, increase the probability of overfitting. 

  @Sullivan1999 and @Hansen2005 provide tests derived from White's Reality Check 
  [which is patented in @White2000], to measure the potential impact of data 
  snooping on the backtested results.

\newthought{One deficiency in the strategy literature} is that it has been 
moving towards utilizing parameter optimization, machine learning, or 
statistical classification methods (such as random forests or neural networks) 
as a silver bullet for strategy development.  While a full treatment is beyond 
the scope of this paper, it is worth mentioning that the model assessment 
and selection techniques of the statistical classification and machine learning 
literature are very valid in the context of evaluating trading strategies. 
[see e.g. @Hastie2009, chapters 7 and 8] We advocate extensive use of model 
validation tests, tests for effective number of parameters, and careful use 
of training and cross validation tests in every part of strategy evaluation. 
Of particular utility is the application of these techniques to each 
*component* of the strategy, in turn, rather than or before testing the 
entire strategy model. (see, e.g. @Kuhn2013)

\newthought{Defining the objectives, hypotheses, and expected outcome(s)} of the 
experiment (backtest) as declared before any strategy code is written or run 
and evaluating against those goals on an ongoing basis will guard against 
many of the error types described above by discarding results that are not 
in line with the stated hypotheses.
___

# Evaluating Each Component of the Strategy ^[*Maintain alertness in each particular instance of particular ways in which our knowledge is incomplete*. - John @Tukey1962 p. 14]

It is important to evaluate each component of the strategy separately. If we
wish to evaluate whether our hypotheses about the market are correct, it does 
not make sense to first build a strategy with many moving parts and meticulously 
fit it to the data until after all the components have been evaluated for their 
own "goodness of fit".

The different components of the strategy, from filters, through indicators, 
signals, and different types of rules, are all trying to express different parts
of the strategy's hypothesis and business objectives. Our goal, at every stage,
should be to confirm that each individual component of the strategy is working: 
adding value, improving the prediction, validating the hypothesis, etc.  before 
moving on to the next component.  

There are several reasons why it is important to test components separately:  

\newthought{Testing individually guards against overfitting.}
As described in the prior section, one of the largest risks of overfitting comes 
from data snooping.  Rejecting an indicator, signal process, or other strategy 
component as quickly in the process as possible guards against doing too much
work fitting a poorly conceived strategy to the data.

\newthought{Tests can be specific to the technique.} 
In many cases, specific indicators, statistical models, or signal processes will
have test methods that are tuned to that technique.  These tests will generally
have better *power* to detect a specific effect in the data.  General tests,
such as *p-values* or *t-tests*, may also be valuable, but their interpretation may
vary from technique to technique, or they may be inappropriate for certain techniques.

\newthought{It is more efficient.} The most expensive thing an analyst has is 
time.  Building strategies is a long, intensive process.  By testing individual 
components you can reject a badly-formed specification.  Re-using components
with known positive properties increases chances of success on a new strategy.
In all cases, this is a more efficient use of time than going all the way through 
the strategy creation process only to reject it at the end. 

______

# Evaluating Indicators

In many ways, evaluating indicators in a vacuum is harder than evaluating 
other parts of the strategy.  It is nearly impossible if you cannot 
express a theory of action for the indicator.  
*Why?*  This is true because the indicator is not just some analytical 
output that has no grounding (at least we hope not).  A good indicator
is describing some measurable aspect of reality: a theoretical "fair value"
price, or the impact of a factor on that price, or turning points 
of the series, or slope.

If we have a good conceptualization of the hypothesized properties of 
the indicator, we can construct what the signal processing field calls 
the 'symmetric filter' on historical data.  These are often  optimized 
ARMA or Kalman-like processes that filter out all the 'noise' to capture
some pre-determined features of the series.  They're (usually) useless 
for prediction, but are very descriptive of past behavior.

It is also possible to do this empirically if you can describe the properties 
in ways that can be readily programmed.  For example, if the indicator is 
supposed to indicate turning points, and is tuned to a mean duration 
of ten periods, then you can look for all turning points that precede a 
short term trend centered around ten periods. The downside of this type
of empirical analysis is that it is inherently a one-off process, developed 
for a specific indicator.

\newthought{How is this useful} in evaluating an indicator?  Once you have constructed 
the symmetric filter, you can evaluate the degree to which the indicator 
matches perfect hindsight.  Using kernel methods, clustering, mean squared error, 
or distance measures we can evaluate the degree of difference between 
the indicator and the symmetric filter.  A low degree of difference (probably)
indicates a good indicator for the features that the symmetric filter has been
tuned to pick up on.

\newthought{The danger of this approach} comes if you've polluted your 
data by going over it too many times. Specifically, if you train the indicator
on the entire data set, then of course it has the best possible fit 
to the data.  Tests for look ahead bias and data snooping bias can help to
detect and guard against that, but the most important guard has to be 
the analyst paying attention to what they are doing, and constructing 
the indicator function or backtest to not use non-contemporaneously 
available data.  Ideally, polluted training periods will be strictly 
limited and near the beginning of the historical series, or something 
like walk forward will be used (sparingly) to choose parameters so
that the parameter choosing process is run over programmatically 
chosen subsets.  Failure to exercise care here leads almost 
inevitably to overfitting (and poor out of sample results). 

An indicator is, at it's core, a measurement used to make a prediction.
This means that the broader literature on statistical predictors is valid.
Many techniques have been developed by statisticians and other modelers 
to improve the predictive value of model inputs.  See @Kuhn2013 or Hastie 
!@Hastie2009. Input scaling, detrending, centering, de-correlating, and many 
other techniques may all be applicable.  The correct adjustments or 
transformations will depend on the nature of the specific indicator.  
Luckily, the statistics literature is also full of diagnostics to help
determine which methods to apply, and what their impact is.  You do need
to remain cognizant of what you give up in each of these cases in terms
of interpretability, trace-ability, or microstructure of the data.

It is also important to be aware of the structural dangers of bars.  Many 
indicators are constructed on periodic or "bar" data.  Bars are not a 
particularly stable analytical unit, and are often sensitive to exact 
starting or ending time of the bar, or to the methodologies used to 
calculate the components (open, high, low, close, volume, etc.) of the bar.
Further, you don't know the ordering of events, whether the high came before 
the low, 
To mitigate these dangers, it is important to test the robustness of the 
bar generating process itself, e.g. by varying the start time of the first 
bar.  We will almost never run complete strategy tests on bar data, preferring
to generate the periodic indicator, and then apply the signal and rules 
processes to higher frequency data. In this way the data used to generate the
indicator is just what is required by the indicator model, with more realistic
market data used for generating signals and for evaluating rules and orders.

The analysis on indicators described here provides another opportunity
to reject your hypothesis, and go back to the drawing board. 

___
# Evaluating Signals 
From one or more indicators, you usually proceed to examining the effectiveness
of the signal generating process.  One of the challenges in evaluating 
the full backtest is that the backtest needs to make multiple assumptions about fills.
We can evaluate signals without making any assumptions about the execution 
that accompanies the desire to express a particular view.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{boxplot}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{A signal is a directional prediction} for a point in time.  
The point in time indicated for the signal will generally vary based on some
parameterization of the indicator and/or signal function(s).  These may be 
plotted using a forward looking boxplot which lines up returns from the signal 
forward by using the signal as $t_0$, and then displaying a boxplot of period 
returns from $t_{1...n}$. Without any assumptions about execution, we
have constructed a distribution of forward return expectations from the
signal generating process.

Many analyses can be done with this data.  You can take a distribution of 
overall return expectations (quantiles, mean, median, standard deviation, 
and standard errors of these estimates), generate a conditional return 
distribution, examine a linear or non-linear fit between the period 
expectations, and compare the expectations of multiple different input 
parameters.  When comparing input parameter expectations, you should see 
'clusters' of similar positive and/or negative return expectations in similar 
or contiguous parameter combinations.  Existence of these clusters indicates 
what @Tomasini2009 refer to as a 'stable region' for the parameters (see 
parameter optimization below). A random assortment of positive expectations is a
bad sign, and should lead to reviewing whether your hypotheses and earlier steps 
are robust.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{gamlss}
\end{marginfigure}

The signals generated by the backtest(s) are also able to be empirically 
classified.  You can measure statistics such as the number of entry and exit 
signals, the distribution of the period between entries and exits, degree of 
overlap between entry and exit signals, and so on.

Given the empirical data about the signal process, it is possible
to develop a simulation of statistically similar processes.  A simulation
of this sort is described by @Aronson2006 for use in evaluating entire
strategy backtest output (more on this below), but it is also useful at this 
earlier stage.  These randomly simulated signal processes should display
(random) distributions of returns, which can be used to assess return bias
introduced by the historical data.  If you parameterize the statistical 
properties of the simulation, you can compare these parameterized simulations
to the expectation generated from each parameterization of the strategy's 
signal generating process.

It is important to separate a parameterized and conditional simulation 
from an unconditional simulation. Many trading system Monte Carlo tools
utilize unconditional sampling.  They then erroneously declare that a good 
system must be due to luck because its expectations are far in the right-hand
tail of the unconditional distribution. One of the only correct inferences that 
you can deduce from a unconditional simulation would be a mean return bias of
the historical series. 

It would make little sense to simulate a system that scalps every tick when 
you are evaluating a system with three signals per week.  It is critical to 
center the simulation parameters around the statistical properties of the 
system you are trying to evaluate.  The simulated signal processes should 
have nearly indistinguishable frequency parameters (number of enter/exit 
signals, holding period, etc.) to the process you are evaluating, to ensure 
that you are really looking at comparable things. 

Because every signal is a prediction, when analyzing signal processes, we 
can begin to fully apply the literature on model specification and testing of 
predictions.  From the simplest available methods such as mean squared model 
error or kernel distance from an ideal process, through extensive evaluation 
as suggested for Akaike's Information Criterion(AIC), Bayesian Information 
Criterion(BIC), effective number of parameters, cross validation of 
@Hastie2009, and including time series specific models such as the data driven 
"revealed performance" approach of @Racine2009: all available tools from the 
forecasting literature should be considered for evaluating proposed signal 
processes.

It should be clear that evaluating the signal generating process offers 
multiple opportunities to re-evaluate assumptions about the method of
action of the strategy, and to detect information bias or luck before 
moving on to (developing and) testing the rest of the strategy.

# Evaluating Rules 

By the time you get to this stage, you should have experimental confirmation 
that the indicator(s) and signal process(es) provide statistically significant
information about the instruments you are examining.  If not, stop and go back
and reexamine your hypotheses.  Assuming that you do have both a theoretical 
and empirical basis on which to proceed, it is time to define the 
strategy's trading rules.  

Much of the work involved in evaluating "technical trading rules" described
in the literature is really an evaluation of signal processes, described 
in depth above. Rules should refine the way the strategy 'listens' to signals,
producing path-dependent actions based on the current state of the market, 
your portfolio, and the indicators and signals.  Separate from whether a 
signal has predictive power or not, as described above, evaluation of rules
is an evaluation of the actions taken in response to the rule.

## entry rules

Most signal processes designed by analysts and described in the literature 
correspond to trade entry.  Described another way, every *entry rule* will 
likely be tightly coupled to a *signal* (possibly a composite signal). 
If the *signal* (prediction) has a positive expectation, then the *rule* 
should have potential to make money.  It is most likely valuable with any 
proposed system to test both aggressive and passive entry order rules.  
If the system makes money in the backtest with a passive entry on a signal, 
but loses money with an aggressive entry which crosses the bid-ask spread, 
or requires execution within a very short time frame after the signal, the 
likelihood that the strategy will work in production is greatly reduced.  
Conversely, if the system is relatively insensitive in the backtest to the 
exact entry rule from the signal process, there will likely be a positive 
expectation for the entry in production.

Another analysis of entry rules that may be carried out both on the backtest 
and in post-trade analysis is to extract the distribution of duration between 
entering the order and getting a fill.  Differences between the backtest and 
production will provide you with information to calibrate the backtest 
expectations.  Information from post trade analysis will provide you with 
information to calibrate your execution and microstructure parameters.  
You can also analyze how conservative or aggressive your backtest fill 
assumptions are by analyzing how many opportunities you may have had to 
trade at the order price after entering the order but before the price 
changes, or how many shares or contracts traded at your order price before 
you would have moved or canceled the order. 

## exit rules

There are two primary classes of exit rules, signal based and empirical;
evaluation and risks for these two groupings is different. Exit rules, 
whether being driven by the same signal process as the entry
rules, or based on empirical evidence from the backtest, are often the 
difference between a profitable and an unprofitable strategy. 

Signal driven exit rules may follow the same signal process as the entry rules
(e.g. band and midpoints models, or RSI-style overbought/oversold models), or
they may have their own signal process. For example, a process that seeks to 
identify slowing or reversal of momentum may be different from a process to 
describe the formation and direction of a trend. When evaluating signal based 
exits, the same process from above for testing aggressive vs. passive order 
logic is likely valuable.  Additionally, testing trailing order logic after 
the signal may "let the winners run" in a statistically significant manner.

Empirical exit rules are usually identified after initial tests of other 
types of exits, or after parameter optimization (see below).  They include 
classic risk stops (see below) and profit targets, as well as trailing take 
profits or pullback stops.  Empirical profit rules are usually identified 
using the outputs of things like Mean Adverse Excursion(MAE)/Mean Favorable 
Excursion(MFE), for example:

 - MFE shows that trades that have advanced *x* % or ticks are unlikely 
   to advance further, so the trade should be taken off
 - a path fit is still strongly positive, even though the signal process
   indicates to be on the lookout for an exit opportunity, so a trailing 
   take profit may be in  order

See more on MAE/MFE below.

## risk rules

There are several types of risk rules that may be tested in the backtest, 
and the goals of adding them should be derived from your business objectives.
By the time you get to adding risk rules in the backtest, the strategy should
be built on a confirmed positive expectation for the signal process, 
signal-based entry and exit rules should have been developed and confirmed,
and any empirical profit taking rules should have been evaluated.
There are two additional "risk" rule types that should commonly be considered 
for addition to the strategy, empirical risk stops, and business constraints. 

Empirical risk stops are generally placed such that they would cut off the 
worst losing trades.  This is very strategy dependent.  You may be able to
get some hints from the signal analysis described above, some examples: 

 - a path dependent fit is strongly negative after putting on the trade
 - the return slope is negative after *x* periods
 
Or, you may place an empirical risk stop based on what you see after 
doing parameter optimization or post trade analysis (see tools below) to cut
off the trade after there is a very low expectation of a winning trade, 
for example:

 - *x* ticks or % against the entry price
 - in the bottom quantile of MAE
 
The business constraint example we most often see in practice is that of a 
drawdown constraint in a levered portfolio.  The drawdown constraint is a clear 
business requirement, imposed by the leverage in the book.  It is possible to
impose drawdown constraints utilizing a risk rule that would flatten the 
position after a certain loss.  While it is common to use catastrophic loss 
rules in strategies, we have had better luck controlling portfolio drawdowns
via diversified asset allocation and portfolio optimization than via risk stops.

@Bailey2014drawdown examines the impact of drawdown based risk rules, and 
adjustments to order sizing based on drawdowns or other changes in account 
equity. They develop an autoregressive model for estimating the potential 
for drawdowns even in high-Sharpe or short history investments.  They further
model the likely time to recover as investment sizes are varied following 
the drawdown.

It is also possible to model risk rules such as hedges or option insurance, 
but these are best done in asset allocation and money management as an overlay 
for the strategy or a portfolio of strategies, and not in the individual 
strategy itself.  Rules to model orthogonal portfolio hedges or option 
insurance significantly complicate the task of evaluating the impact of the 
rules designed for the regular functioning of the strategy.

As with other parts of strategy development and testing, it is again important
to formulate a hypothesis about the effects of exit rules that you plan to add,
and to document their intended effects, and the business reasons you've chosen
for adding them.  This is especially important if you are adding rules after 
parameter optimization.  Done poorly, exit or risk rules added after parameter 
optimization are just cherry picking the best returns, while if done properly
they may be used to take advantage of what you've learned about the statistical
expectations for the system, and may improve out of sample correspondence to the 
in-sample periods.

## order sizing

We tend to do minimal order sizing in backtests.  Most of our backtests are 
run on "one lot" or equivalent portfolios.  The reason is that the backtest 
is trying to confirm the hypothetical validity of the trading system, not 
really trying to optimize execution beyond a certain point.  How much order
sizing makes sense in a backtest is dependent on the strategy and your 
business objectives. Typically, we will do "leveling" or "pyramiding" studies
while backtesting, starting from our known-profitable business practices.  
We will *not* do "compounding" or "percent of equity" studies, because our
goal in backtesting is to confirm the validity of the positive expectation 
and rules embodied in the system, not to project revenue opportunities.
Once we have a strategy model we believe in, and especially once we have 
been able to calibrate the model on live trades, we will tend to drive order 
sizing from microstructure analysis, post trade analysis of our execution,
and portfolio optimization.

## rule burden

\newthought{Beware of rule burden.} 
Too many rules will make a backtest look excellent in-sample, and may 
even work in walk forward analysis, but are very dangerous in production.
One clue that you are over-fitting by adding too many rules is that
you add a rule or rules to the backtest *after* running an exhaustive 
analysis and being disappointed in the results.  This is introducing 
data snooping bias.  Some data snooping is unavoidable, but if you've 
run multiple parameter optimizations on your training set or (worse)
multiple walk forward analyses, and then added rules after each run,
you're likely introducing dangerous biases in your output.

# Parameter optimization ^[*Every trading system is in some form an optimization.* (Tomasini)]

Parameter optimization is important for indicators, signals, rules, and 
complete trading systems.  Care needs to be taken to do this as safely as 
possible.  That care needs to start with clearly defined objectives, as 
has already been stated.  The goal of parameter optimization should be to 
locate a parameter combination that most closely matches the hypotheses 
and objectives.  To avoid overfitting, it is also critical to avoid outliers,
looking for stable regions of both in and out of sample performance.
[@Tomasini2009 , pp. 49--56]

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{param_region}
\end{marginfigure}

When a parameter or set of parameters is robust, it will have a few key 
properties:

- small parameter changes lead to small changes in P\&L and objective 
  expectations
- out of sample deterioration is not large, on average (see walk forward 
  optimization)
- parameter choices have a sound theoretical or economic basis
- parameter variation should produce correlated differences in multiple 
  objectives

For small numbers of parameters, it may be sufficient to graph parameters 
against your objective, use quantiles, or examine neighbors around a 
candidate parameter set.  When there are more than a couple of parameters, 
or more than one objective, the inference to find a "stable region" is 
somewhat more difficult.  Quantiles of the parameter sets lined up against 
the objectives are still useful, but you may need to cluster these values 
to find the best intersection, or apply formal global optimization solvers
with a penalized objective to locate the best combination of parameters.

\newthought{Limiting the degrees of freedom} in your parameter optimization
is another way to guard against overfitting and data mining biases.  
Most real strategies have only a few influential parameters, out of many
other "fine tuning" parameters.  When backtesting, focus on the major drivers.
These major drivers should be known in advance, from the theory 
of the strategy.  If they are not obvious from the theory of the strategy,
first work on refining the hypothesis so its premises may be tested.  If
that is not possible or is still insufficient, effective parameter testing 
[@Hastie2009] can help to identify the major drivers in a small training and 
testing set from the beginning of the data. By limiting the degrees of 
freedom in this way, you limit the opportunities to cherry pick lucky 
combinations, and statistically the required adjustment for data mining 
bias is reduced, as are the number of trials (resulting in faster 
parameter searches).

\newthought{Incremental evaluation of rules} is another advanced form of 
parameter optimization usually paired with more advanced global optimization 
solvers or machine learning.  Incremental rule evaluation runs the 
strategy with different combinations of rules.  In a normal evaluation 
of this type, rules are separated by type (entry, exit, risk, rebalance, 
and so on), and various combinations are tried, starting with minimal 
enter/exit pairs, and adding incrementally to complexity.  These types
of trials can be very informative as to what adds value to the strategy.  
If not carefully controlled, they can also result in significant out of
sample deterioration (see walk forward analysis).  

\newthought{Choosing the best parameter set} should be a function of 
your business objectives.  In the simplest case, your selection algorithm
should maximize or minimize your business objective.  In more complex cases,
you will likely have multiple business objectives, and will utilize a 
penalized multi-objective optimization to choose the best combination.
In an ideal case, you will also have a view on slope and linearity of the 
equity curve, described by something like Kestner's K-Ratio[-@Kestner2003],
which is really the t-test on the linear model, or by other descriptive
statistics for goodness of fit or model choice [see @Ripley2004 for an overview].

___
# Walk Forward Analysis 

A logical extension of parameter optimization, walk forward analysis 
utilizes a rolling or expanding window as 'in-sample' (IS) for parameterization
and another period as 'out of sample' (OOS) using the chosen parameters.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{walk_forward_gantt}
\end{marginfigure}

\newthought{Most strategies do not have stable parameters through time.}
The world's top investors, in all styles and frequencies, adjust their 
expectations, outlook, and approach over time as market conditions change.
Warrent Buffett or Ray Dalio say that they follow the same "strategy" 
over decades, but they still adapt to changing markets.  
Walk forward analysis allows the parameterization of the strategy to 
change over time as market conditions change.

\newthought{Walk forward analysis guards against data mining bias.}
At first, this may be counter-intuitive, as walk forward analysis is a 
data mining process.  
Barring regime shift (more on this later), the strategist generally assumes 
local stationarity in market conditions.  If we are conducting parameter 
optimization in alignment with our previously stated business objectives 
(supplemented by statistical measures of goodness of fit), then
utilizing walk forward analysis describes the strategy parameterization 
that would have been most appropriate for the business at a point in time.
If you are truly in a region of local stationarity in market characteristics,
then you are choosing optimal parameters for your out of sample period
*without* looking ahead and incurring bias.  

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics{walk_forward_chart}
\end{marginfigure}

Another guard against data snooping bias is to have your walk forward 
periods be realistic. If the strategy is hard to parameterize, or uses 
hard to get or periodic data, then your walk forward analysis should 
reflect these difficulties. 

For example, you should make sure that you:

- Choose between anchored walk forward or rolling walk forward based 
  on whether the theoretical properties of your indicators(s) would 
  benefit from that.
- Only reparameterize the free parameters for the whole strategy on a 
  frequency that makes sense for your strategy and business.  Indicators 
  that adapt to changes in market data automatically are probably safer 
  than doing frequent parameter searches of the recent past.
- Don't vary the length of in and out of sample periods across multiple 
  tests, unless you are using such variations to model out of sample 
  deterioration.
- If you use macroeconomic data released periodically (monthly or quarterly),
  your in and out of sample periods should reflect when information arrives
  to change how the strategy operates.
- Understand whether windowing effects would strongly influence the results. 
  If windowing effects are present, consider an anchored walk forward.

In addition to the choosing mechanism used for parameter analysis, you may 
additionally evaluate turnover and correspondence between in and out 
of sample performance.  On turnover, you may choose to stay with the 
parameter set you are already running, or the set with the lowest turnover,
if the performance of this zero or low turnover parameter set is within 
the error bounds of the estimation.  If you are utilizing a 
population-based optimizer, it makes sense to evaluate the top performers
from the in-sample period in the out of sample period, and utilize 
the ones with the least drift as part of your starting population for 
your next (non-overlapping) walk forward period.

\newthought{Walk forward analysis should be used sparingly.}  One risk of
using walk forward analysis is that you can introduce data snooping biases 
if you apply it multiple times with differing goals, looking for the best 
outcomes^[see cross validation section, below, for additional cautionary
notes about correct use of walk forward analysis].  As with objective and 
hypothesis generation, you should be clear about the definition of success 
before performing the test and polluting your data set with prior knowledge.  

___
# Regime Analysis

\newthought{Parameter optimization and walk forward analysis assume local stationarity.}

*How do you know if this is a reasonable assumption?*

Regime models attempt to provide this information.  Many financial time series
exhibit distinct states, with specific properties differing sharply between
these different 'regimes'.  There are two primary classes of models that are 
used for detecting regimes, Markov switching models and change point models. 
In the context of strategy development, it can make sense to both test for 
regime behaviors and develop a plan for managing regime change. If your data
has well-defined regimes, and you can model these, you may find that very 
different parameter sets are appropriate for the strategy in those regimes, 
or that no parameter set produces reasonable results out of sample in 
particularly challenging regimes, or that no change is necessary.  In any
case, once you have a strategy model you believe in, doing some regime 
analysis may provide some additional marginal benefit.

# Evaluating Trades

Entire books have been written extolling the virtues or lamenting the problems 
of one performance measure over another.  We have chosen to take a rather 
inclusive approach both to trade and P\&L based measures and to return based 
measures (covered later).  Generally, we run as many metrics as we can, and 
look for consistently good metrics across all common return and cash based 
measures. Trade and P\&L based measures have an advantage of being precise 
and reconcilable to clearing statements, but disadvantages of not
being easily comparable between products, after compounding, etc.  

\newthought{What is a trade, anyway?}

The word "trade" has different meanings in different parts and types of 
strategy analysis. Certainly a single transaction is a "trade".  When 
speaking of "trades" in "trade statistics" you usually mean a pair or 
more of transactions that both open and close a position.

There are several ways of calculating the round trip "trades".  The 
most common are FIFO, tax lots, flat to flat, and flat to reduced.

1. FIFO

    FIFO is "first in, first out", and pairs entry and exit transactions by 
    time priority.  We generally do not calculate statistics on FIFO because 
    it is impossible to match P\&L to clearing statements; very few 
    institutional investors will track to FIFO.  FIFO comes from accounting 
    for physical inventory, where old (first) inventory is accounted for in the
    first sales of that inventory. It can be very difficult to calculate a cost 
    basis if the quantities of your orders vary, or you get a large number of 
    partial fills, as any given closing fill may be an amalgam of multiple
    opening fills.
        
2. tax lots

    Tax lot "trades" pair individual entry and exit transactions together 
    to gain some tax advantage such as avoiding short term gains, harvesting
    losses, lowering the realized gain, or shifting the realized gain or loss 
    to another tax period or tax jurisdiction.  This type of analysis can 
    be very beneficial, though it will be very dependent on the goals of the 
    tax lot construction.
    
3. flat to flat
    
    Flat to flat "trade" analysis marks the beginning of the trade from the
    first transaction to move the position off zero, and marks the end of
    the "trade" with the transaction that brings the P\&L back to zero, 
    or "flat".
    It will match brokerage statements of realized P\&L when the positions is 
    flat and average cost of open positions always, so it is easy to reconcile 
    production trades using this methodology.  One advantage of the flat to flat 
    methodology is that there are no overlapping "trades" so doing things like
    bootstrap, jackknife, or Monte Carlo analysis on those trades is not 
    terribly difficult. The challenge of using flat to flat is that it will 
    not work well for strategies that are rarely flat; if a strategy adjusts 
    its position up or down, levels into trades, etc. then getting useful 
    aggregate statistics from flat to flat analysis may be difficult.
    
4. flat to reduced

    The flat to reduced methodology marks the beginning of the "trade" from 
    the first transaction to increase the position, and ends a "trade" when
    the position is reduced at all, going closer to zero.  Brokerage 
    accounting practices match this methodology exactly, they will adjust 
    the average cost of the open position as positions get larger or further
    from flat, and will realize gains whenever the position gets smaller 
    (closer to flat). Flat to reduced is our preferred methodology most of the
    time. This methodology works poorly for bootstrap or other trade 
    resampling methodologies, as some of the aggregate statistics are highly 
    intercorrelated because multiple "trades" share the same entry point.
    You need to be aware of the skew in some statistics that may be created
    by this methodology and either correct for it or not use those 
    statistics. Specific problems will depend on the strategy and 
    trading pattern. The flat to reduced method is a good default choice for 
    "trade" definition because it is the easiest to reconcile to statements, 
    other execution and analysis software, and accounting and regulatory standards.
   
5. increased to reduced

    An analytically superior alternative to FIFO is "increased to reduced".
    This approach marks the beginning of a "trade" any time the position 
    increases (gets further from flat/zero) and marks the end of a trade
    when the position is decreased (gets smaller in absolute terms, closer 
    to flat), utilizing average cost for the cost basis.  Typically, flat to 
    flat periods will be extracted, and then broken into pieces matching each 
    reduction to an increase, in expanding order from the first reduction. 
    This is "time and quantity" priority, and is analytically more repeatable 
    and manageable than FIFO.  If you have a reason for utilizing FIFO-like 
    analysis, consider using "increased to reduced" instead.  Be aware that the 
    "trade" statistics will not be reconcilable to any brokerage statement, 
    this is purely an analytical methodology.
   
\newthought{Aggregate trade statistics are calculated on the entire backtest.}

Basically all modern backtesting and execution platforms can calculate and 
report aggregated trade statistics for the entire test period. Typically,
you will be looking at these statistics to confirm that the performance of 
the strategy is as expected for its class, and in-line with the expectations 
you established from the components of the strategy. 

+ common trade statistics :
    - number of transactions and "trades" performed 
    - gross and net trading profits/losses (P\&L) 
    - mean/median trading P\&L per trade 
    - standard deviation of trade P\&L 
    - largest winning/losing trade 
    - percent of positive/negative trades  
    - Profit Factor : absolute value ratio of gross profits over gross losses 
    - mean/median P\&L of profitable/losing trades 
    - annualized Sharpe-like ratio 
    - max drawdown 
    - start-trade drawdown [@Fitschen2013, p. 185]
    - win/loss ratios of winning over losing trade P\&L (total/mean/median) 


Some authors advocate testing the strategy against "perfect profit", the 
potential profit of buying every upswing and selling every downswing. 
Such a "perfect profit" number is meaningless in almost all circumstances,
as it relies on a number of assumptions of periodicity, execution technology, 
etc. that are certain to be false.  While it would be possible to create an 
"ideal profit" metric for a given strategy which would have similar stochastic
entry/exit properties to the strategy being evaluated, our assertion is that 
this type of simulation is more appropriately situated with analysis of
the signal process, as described above.  It is certainly possible to extend 
the signal analysis as described above to a given fixed set of rules, but 
we believe this is an invitation to overfitting, and prefer to only perform
that kind of speculative analysis inside the structure of a defined 
experimental design such as parameter optimization, walk forward analysis, 
or *k*-fold cross validation on strategy implementations. Leave the 
simulated data much earlier in the process when confirming the power of the
strategy components.

The goal of many trading strategies is to produce a smoothly upward sloping 
equity curve.  To compare the output of your strategy to an idealized 
representation, most methodologies utilize linear models.  The linear fit 
of the equity curve may be tested for slope, goodness of fit, and confidence
bounds. @Kestner2003 proposes the K-Ratio, which is the p-test statistic on 
the linear model.  Pardo [-@Pardo2008 pp. 202--209] emphasizes the number of trades, 
and the slope of the resulting curve.  You can extend the analysis beyond 
the simple linear model to generalized linear models or generalized additive 
models, which can provide more robust fits that do not vary as much with small 
changes to the inputs.

**Dangers of aggregate statistics ...**

- hiding the most common outcomes
- focusing on extremes
- not enough trades or history for validity
- colinearities of flat to reduced


\newthought{Per-Trade statistics can provide insight for fine-tuning.}

Analyzing individual trades can give you insight into how the strategy 
performs on a very fine-grained level.

Especially for path dependent behaviors such as:

- developing a distribution of trade performances and volatilities,
- validating the signal expectations, which were inherently forward looking,
- quick dips or run-ups immediately after the trade is put on, 
- frequent drawdowns from peak before taking the trade off, 
- positive or negative excursions while the trade is on.

\newthought{Analyzing excursions can provide empirical support} from the 
backtest for setting risk stops or profit taking levels.
    \begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{MAE}
    \end{marginfigure}
Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE) or Maximum Favorable Excursion (MFE) show how 
far down (or up) every trade went during the course of its life-cycle.  You 
can capture information on how many trades close close to their highs or lows,
as well as evaluating points at which the P\&L for the trade statistically
just isn't going to get any better, or isn't going to recover.  While
not useful for all strategies, many strategies will have clear patterns that
may be incorporated into risk or profit rules.

You can also separate the individual trades into quantiles (or other slices)
by any statistic that you have available.  The different distributions,
paths, and properties of these quantiles will frequently provide insight into 
methods of action in the strategy, and can lead to further strategy development.

It is important when evaluating MAE/MFE to do this type of analysis in your test
set.  One thing that you want to test out of sample is whether the MAE threshold
is stable over time.  You want to avoid, as with other parts of the strategy, 
going over and "snooping" the data for the entire test period, or all your 
target instruments.   

___
# Post Trade Analysis

Post trade analysis offers an opportunity to calibrate the things you learned 
in the backtest, and generate more hypotheses for improving the strategy. 
Analyzing fills may proceed using all the tools described earlier in this 
document. Additionally, you now have enough data with which to model slippage 
from the model prices, as well as any slippage (positive or negative) from the 
other backtest statistics.

One immediate benefit for post trade analysis is that you already have all 
the tools to evaluate performance; they have been applied to every component 
of the strategy.  Tests and output of all the analyses are already specified,
and may be compared directly.

\newthought{Some analysis is unique to post trade analysis.}
Direct reconciliation between the backtest and production requires both the 
theoretical and production output have all the same information available for 
modeled prices, orders, and execution reports.  Once in the same format,
it is possible to analyze variances in:

- modeled theoretical price (these should match in most cases)
- order timing and prices
- P\&L
- evolution of the position, including partial fill analysis

Backtests tend to model complete fills, and use deliberately conservative 
fill assumptions. One outcome of this is that many strategies can receive 
more or earlier fills in production.  If you've modeled your signal 
expectations, these may be run over the production period as well, and 
you can develop a model for when and how completely fills occur in production 
after the signals and rules of the model would have wanted to be filled. It 
is sometimes also reasonable to have a limited adjustment to (overly) 
conservative fill assumptions of the backtest more clearly match reality.
You can also model slippages at this point, in price, quantity, and time. 

Our practice is to impose haircuts on the research model based on production 
results.  All negative results, whether the fault of the model or of
execution, will be used to lower the backtest expectations on future
trials.  All positive production results better than the model will be 
appropriately celebrated, but will not be used to 'upward adjust' the model.  

Reconciliation of the differences will often lead to improvements in
the strategy, or its production execution.

#Microstructure Analysis 

\newthought{Microstructure can not be easily tested in a backtest.}
The nature of backtesting is that you want to try many combinations quickly.  
As such, the data you use for a backtest is almost always at least minimally 
reduced from full L2 market data.  If you have a desire or a need to 
formulate an opinion about how the strategy will perform given market 
microstructure, this will be very hard to simulate, even from full L2 data.
While simulators exist for L2 data that are quite accurate most of those
are stochastic, very computationally intensive, and need to be run 
hundreds or thousands of times with minor variations in assumptions and 
timing.  

Some things can be known from the L2 data without a simulator:

- distribution or composition of the book
- likelihood that the market will turn to a new price
- total shown size for a given level at a certain point in time

To refine expectations of execution, you have to gather real trade data.  
By doing post trade analysis (see above) you can line up orders and fills 
with the L1 or L2 book data, dealing with things like jitter and skew in the 
timestamps.  You can then draw inferences about likelihoods of getting 
filled, market impact, how your MAE/MFE and other trade statistics relate 
to the backtest.

When much of the overall net performance of the strategy depends on 
the execution the only way to refine that expectation is to gather 
real data on the target system, or to use an informative prior 
constructed from a similar system that was or is actually traded 
in production.  When you know that the signal process has a positive
expectation, and a reasonable backtest also shows a positive expectation,
one of the best ways to adjust the theoretical expectation is to 
calibrate it against the output of post trade analysis.

#Evaluating Returns

Returns create a *standard* mechanism for comparing 
multiple strategies or managers using all the tools of portfolio and risk 
analysis that have been developed for investment and portfolio management.
Returns based analysis is most valuable at daily or lower periodicities 
(often requiring aggregating intraday transaction performance to daily returns)
, is easily comparable across assets or strategies, and has many analytical 
techniques not available for trades and P\&L. Returns are not easily
reconcilable back to the trades both because of the transformation done to
get to returns, changes in scale over time, and possible aggregation to lower 
or regular frequencies different from the trading frequency. 

\newthought{Choice of the denominator matters.} In a retail account, capital
is a specific number and is usually not in question.  Accounting for 
additions and withdrawals is straightforward.  In a back test or in an 
institutional account, the choice of denominator is less clear. Several 
options exist, any or all of which may be reasonable.  The first is to use 
a fixed denominator.  This has the advantage of being simple, and assumes 
that gains are not reinvested.  Another related option is to use a fixed 
starting capital.  This option is as simple as the fixed denominator, but
assumes that gains are reinvested into the strategy. A third option is to 
look at return on exchange margin.  Return on margin has the challenge of 
knowing what the required margin was, which requires access to things like 
a SPAN engine, or to historical portfolio reports from live trading of the 
strategy.

\newthought{Should we use cash or percent returns?}  If the strategy utilizes 
the same order sizing in contract or cash terms throughout the tested period, 
then cash P\&L should work fine.  If instead the "money management" of the 
strategy reinvests gains or changes order sizes based on account equity, then
you will need to resample percent returns, or your results will not be 
unbiased.  The cash P\&L would exhibit a (presumably upward) bias from the 
portfolio growth in  the backtest portfolio over the course of the test if the 
strategy is reinvesting. Conversely, if the strategy does not change order 
sizes during the test (e.g. fixed 1-lot sizing), then using percent returns 
versus account equity will show a downward bias in returns, as account equity
grows, but order sizes remain constant.  In this case, you may choose to use
a fixed/constant denominator to get to simple "returns", which would be the 
equivalent of saying that any cash generated by the strategy was withdrawn.

Many analytical techniques presume percent return-based analysis rather than 
analysis on cash P\&L.  Some examples include:
- tail risk measures
- volatility analysis
- factor analysis
    - factor model Monte Carlo
- style analysis
- applicability to asset allocation (see below)


\newthought{Comparing strategies in return space} can also be a good reason to 
use percent returns rather than cash.  When comparing strategies, working in 
return-space may allow for disparate strategies to be placed on a similar 
footing.  Things like risk measures often make more sense when described 
against their percent impact on capital, for example.

While it may be tempting to do all of the analysis of a trading strategy in 
only cash P&L, or only in return space, it is valuable to analyze almost every
strategy in both ways, as the two approaches provide different insight.

# Rebalancing and asset allocation

Once the strategy is basically complete, and preferably in production, then 
you can work at marginal improvement to return and risk via rebalancing and 
asset allocation.  We prefer to do this analysis on real trade data (see 
Post Trade Analysis) rather than backtest data, when possible.

Asset allocation should support your business objectives for return and risk.
This may be a good time to revisit the business objective and make sure the 
business objective is suitable for optimization.  If the business objectives
are formulated as described above in the section on business objectives, this
should require no additional work.

The *Kelly Criterion*, and the closely related *optimal f* and *Leverage Space Portfolio Model* 
(*LSPM*) of Vince [-@Vince2009] seek to choose an optimal bet size given uncertainty
of the outcome of any single bet. Kelly and optimalf come out of betting, where
the goal is to determine the optimal bet size given some edge and a certain 
capital pool.  LSPM extends this model to a portfolio allocation context given 
a joint distribution of drawdowns.  All three of these models seek to maximize 
final wealth, the first two without regard to path, and LSPM while limiting the
joint probability of some drawdown to a business-acceptable threshold.  The 
most difficult challenge in utilizing LSPM is in estimating the joint probability 
and magnitude of drawdowns, making the method increasingly difficult for larger
portfolios of trading strategies.

There are some particular challenges in using portfolio optimization for trading 
strategies. Once you have real trade data, and have aggregated it to a suitable 
time frame (typically daily), that daily cash return for the strategy or an 
instrument or configuration within the strategy is essentially a synthetic 
instrument return.  When doing portfolio allocation among multiple choices, 
you ideally want a large number of observations.  An order of magnitude more 
observations for each asset, strategy, or configuration than the number of 
synthetic assets you'll have in the optimization is usually near the minimum 
stable observations set.  So 60 observations for each of six synthetic assets 
in the portfolio, for example.

\newthought{What if you don't have enough data?} Let's suppose you want 500 
observations for each of 50 synthetic assets based on the rule of thumb above. 
That is approximately two years of daily returns.  This number of observations
would likely produce a high degree of confidence if you had been running the
strategy on 50 synthetic assets for two years in a stable way. If you 
want to allocate capital in alignment with your business objectives before you 
have enough data, you can do a number of things:
- use the data you have and re-optimize frequently to check for stability and 
  add more data
- use higher frequency data, e.g. hourly instead of daily
- use a technique such as Factor Model Monte Carlo (Jiang 2007, Zivot 2011,2012) 
  to construct equal histories
- optimize over fewer assets, requiring a smaller history

\newthought{Fewer assets?} Suppose you have three strategies, each with 
20 configurations.  Using the rule of thumb above, you'd want a minimum of
600 days of production results.  If instead you use the aggregate return of
each of the three strategies, you could likely get a directionally correct
optimization result from 30 or so observations, or a month and a half of daily 
data with all three strategies running.  More data is generally better, if 
available.  This compares well in practice to the three years of monthly returns 
(36 observations) often used for fund of hedge funds investments.

\newthought{What if you have lots of strategies and configurations?} Suppose
we have many strategies, each with many configurations or traded assets. 
In the likely case that you don't have enough data to optimize over all the 
configurations as in the example above, you can optimize over just the 
aggregate strategy returns as described above.  At this point your most mature
strategy or strategies may very well have enough data for optimization 
separately.  This opens the way for what is called layered objectives and 
optimization.  You may have different business objectives for a single
strategy, e.g. the objectives for a market maker and a medium term trend
follower are different.  In this case, it is preferable to optimize the
configurations for a single strategy, generating an OOS return for the 
strategy on a daily scale that may be used as the input to the multi-strategy
optimization described above.  This layered optimization is well-supported 
in **R**.

\newthought{How often should you rebalance?} Most academic literature on 
optimal portfolio allocation seems to operate on an assumption of continuous 
rebalancing. Such an assumption is rarely warranted in practice due to:

- cost of rebalancing trades
- time to perform complex portfolio optimization
- data management required to be ready to do optimization
- uncertainty in conversion from weights to order sizes (see below)
- conversion of optimization output into strategy parameters 

It typically makes sense to choose a less frequent rebalance period.
Periods which may make sense for your production portfolio include, but
are not limited to:

- calendar periods such as weeks or months
- periods when cash is added or withdrawn
- infrequently enough to measure out of sample deterioration with reasonable 
  statistical confidence
- when new strategies leave small scale incubation and are ready to be scaled up 
  to larger production sizes
- at a frequency efficient for your available computing resources

- *rebalancing implications*
- *discuss implications of Factor Model Monte Carlo*

# Probability of Overfitting ^[*We should recognize the reality that any simulated (backtest) performance presented to us likely overstates future prospects. By how much? -Antti Ilmanen* [-@Ilmanen2011] p. 112 ] 

\newthought{This entire paper has been devoted to avoiding overfitting.}
At the end of the modeling process, we still need to evaluate how likely 
it is that the model may be overfit, and develop a haircut for the model
that may identify how much out of sample deterioration could be expected.

With all of the methods described in this section, it is important to note 
that you are no longer measuring performance; that was covered in prior 
sections.  At this point, we are measuring statistical error, and developing
or refuting the level of confidence which may be appropriate for the backtest
results.  We have absolutely *fitted* the strategy to the data, but is it 
*over*-fit?  With what confidence and error estimates can we identify the 
fitting?  

## out of sample deterioration

\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{OOS_det}
  \caption{source:Aronson}
\end{marginfigure}

We need to measure the degradation that occurs OOS in a consistent fashion. 
    
  - linear measurement via lm  
  - measurement and reconciliation of trade stats
  - application of OOS deterioration measurement to Walk Forward and *k*-folds

It can be very informative to consider all of the IS and OOS periods from walk 
forward analysis, and apply the OOS degradation measurements to these periods. 
Over time, you can hope to learn about modifications to your objective function 
or strategy development process which would decrease OOS degradation. 

## resampled trades
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{resampling1}
  \caption{source:Tomasini}
\end{marginfigure}

Tomasini[-@Tomasini2009, pp. 104--109] describes a basic resampling mechanism 
for trades.  The period returns for all "flat to flat" trades in the backtest 
(and the flat periods with period returns of zero) which are sampled without 
replacement.  After all trades or flat periods have been sampled, a new time 
series is constructed by applying the original index to the resampled returns.
This gives a number of series which will have the same mean and net return as 
the original backtest, but differing drawdowns and tail risk measures.  This 
allows confidence bounds to be placed on the drawdown and tail risk statistics 
based on the resampled returns.

This analysis can be extended to resample without replacement only the 
duration and quantity of the trades.  These entries, exits, and flat periods 
are then applied to the original price data.  This will generate a series of 
returns which are potentially very different from the original backtest. ^[ We 
are applying these methodologies here to gain or refute confidence in backtested 
results.  All of these analytical methods may also be applied to post trade 
analysis to gain insight into real trades and execution processes.] In this 
model, average trade duration, percent time in market, and percent time long 
and short will remain the same, but all the performance statistics will vary 
based on the new path of the returns.  This should allow a much more coherent 
placement of the chosen strategy configuration versus other strategy 
configurations with similar time series statistical properties.  

@Burns2006 describes a number of tests that may be applied to the resampled
returns to evaluate the key question of skill versus luck.  You should be able 
to determine via the p-value control statistics some confidence that the 
strategy is the product of skill rather than luck as well as the strength of
the predictive power of the strategy in a manner similar to that obtained 
earlier on the signal processes.  You can also apply all the analysis that 
was utilized on evaluating the strategy and its components along the way to
the resampled returns, to see where in the distribution of statistics the 
chosen strategy configuration fits.

*What if your strategy is never flat?*  These resampling methods presume flat 
to flat construction, where trades are marked from flat points in the backtest.
Things get substantially more complicated if the strategy is rarely flat, 
consider for example a long only trend follower which adds and removes position 
around a core bias position over very long periods of time, or a market making 
strategy which adds and reduces positions around some carried inventory.  In 
these cases constructing resampled returns that are statistically similar 
to the original strategy is very difficult.  One potential choice it to make
use of the "increased to reduced" trade definition methodology.  If you are
considering only one instrument, or a series of independent instruments, 
the increased to reduced methodology can be appropriately applied.^[one of the
only cases in which a FIFO style methodology provides useful statistical 
information] 

If the instruments are dependent or highly correlated, the difficulty level of 
drawing useful statistical inference goes up yet again.  In the case of 
dependent or highly correlated instruments or positions, you may need to 
rely on portfolio-level Monte Carlo analysis rather than attempting to resample 
trades.  While it may be useful to learn if the dependent structure adds to 
overall returns over the random independent resampled case, it is unlikely to 
give you much insight into improving the strategy, or much confidence about the
strategy configuration that has made it all the way to these final analyses.

*what can we learn from resampling methods?*  

*what would be incorrect inferences?*



## Monte Carlo
If there is strong correlation or dependence between instruments in the 
backtest, then you will probably have to resample or perform Monte Carlo 
analysis from portfolio-level returns, rather than trades.  You lose the 
ability to evaluate trade statistics, but will still be able to assess 
the returns of the backtest against the sampled portfolios for your 
primary business objectives and benchmarks. As was discussed in more detail 
under *Evaluating Signals*, it is important that any resampled data preserve
the autocorrelation structure of the original data to the degree possible.

## White's Reality Check 
White's Data Mining Reality Check from @White2000 (usually referred to as DRMC or
just "White's Reality Check" WRC) is a bootstrap based test which compares the 
strategy returns to a benchmark.  The ideas were expanded in @Hansen2005. It 
creates a set of bootstrap returns and then checks via absolute or mean squared
error what the chances that the model could have been the result of random 
selection. It applies a *p-value* test between the bootstrap distribution and 
the backtest results to determine whether the results of the backtest appear to 
be statistically significant.

## cross validation

Cross validation is a widely used statistical technique for model evaluation.  
In its classical statistical form, the data is cut in half, the model is 
trained on one half, and then the trained model is tested on the half of
the model that was "held out".  As such, this type of model will often be
referred to as a *single hold out* cross validation model.  In time series
analysis, the classical formulation is often modified to use a smaller 
hold-out period than half the data, in order to create a larger training set.
Challenges with single hold out cross validation include that one out of sample 
set is hard to draw firm inferences from, and that the OOS period may 
additionally be too short to generate enough signals and trades to gain 
confidence in the model.

In many ways, walk forward analysis is related to cross validation.  The 
OOS periods in walk forward analysis are effectively validation sets as in
cross validation.  You can and should measure the out of sample deterioration
of your walk forward model between the IS performance and the OOS performance 
of the model.  One advantage of walk forward is that it allows parameters to 
change with the data.  One disadvantage is that there is a temptation to make
the OOS periods for walk forward analysis rather small, making it very 
difficult to measure deterioration from the training period.  Another potential 
disadvantage is that the IS periods are overlapping, which can be expected to 
create autocorrelation among the parameters.  This autocorrelation is mixed
from an analysis perspective. A degree of parameter stability is usually 
considered an advantage. The IS periods are not all independent draws from the 
data, and the OOS periods will later be used as IS periods, so any analytical
technique that assumes *i.i.d.* observations should be viewed at least with 
skepticism.

*k*-fold cross validation improves on the classical single hold-out OOS 
model by randomly dividing the sample of size *T* into sequential 
sub-samples of size *T/k*.[ @Hastie2009] Alternately or additionally, something 
like a jackknife or block bootstrap may be used to maintain some of the serial 
structure while providing more samples. The strategy model is fit using the 
fitting procedure (e.g. parameter search and/or walk forward analysis) on the
entire set of *k-1* samples, in turn, and then tested on the *k-th* sample 
which was held out.  This procedure is repeated using each *k* sample as the 
holdout.  There is some work which must be done on price-based vs return-based
time series to make the series continuous, e.g. the series must be turned into 
simple differences and then back converted into a price series after the folds
have been recombined, and an artificial time index must be imposed. 
One weakness with *k*-fold cross validation for trading strategies resides in 
the fact that the length of each *T/k* section must be long enough to have a 
reasonable error bound on the objectives in the OOS segments.[@Bailey2014probability , p.17 ]
While we think that this is important to note, in the same manner that it is 
always important to understand the statistical error bounds of your 
calculations, it is not a fatal flaw.  

Some question exists whether *k*-fold cross validation is appropriate for time
series in the same way that it is for categorical or panel data.  Rob Hyndman
addresses this directly here^[http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscvexample/] 
and here^[https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5/].  What he describes as "forecast
evaluation with a rolling origin" is essentially Walk Forward Analysis. One 
important takeaway from Prof. Hyndman's treatment of the subject is that it is 
important to define the expected result and tests to measure forecast accuracy 
*before* performing the (back)test.  Then, all the tools of forecast evaluation 
may be applied to evaluate how well your forecast is doing out of sample, and 
whether you are likely to have overfit your model.
