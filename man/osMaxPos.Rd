\title{order sizing function for position limits and level sizing}
\usage{
osMaxPos(data, timestamp, orderqty, ordertype, orderside, portfolio, symbol,
  ruletype, digits = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{an xts object containing market data.  depending on rules, may need to be in OHLCV or BBO formats, and may include indicator and signal information}

\item{timestamp}{timestamp coercible to POSIXct that will be the time the order will be inserted on}

\item{orderqty}{numeric quantity of the desired order, modified by osFUN}

\item{ordertype}{one of "market","limit","stoplimit", or "stoptrailing"}

\item{orderside}{one of either "long" or "short"}

\item{portfolio}{text name of the portfolio to place orders in}

\item{symbol}{identifier of the instrument to place orders for.  The name of any associated price objects (xts prices, usually OHLC) should match these}

\item{ruletype}{one of "risk","order","rebalance","exit","enter", see \code{\link{add.rule}}}

\item{digits}{call \code{\link{round}} to round min/max clip size to specified number of digits}

\item{...}{any other passthru parameters}
}
\description{
levels are a simplification of more complex (proprietary) 
techniques sometimes used for order sizing.  
the max orderqty returned will be the limit/levels
Obviously the strategy rules could ask for smaller order sizes, 
but this is the default.  If you don't want to use levels, set 
them to 1.
}
\details{
\code{orderqty='all'} in a risk rule will return an order size 
appropriate to flatten the current position.
}
\note{
TODO integrate orderqty='all' into osMaxPos for non-risk exit orders by combining side and pos for exits
